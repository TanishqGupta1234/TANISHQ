QUESTION1
Two Sum:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.
int* twoSum(int* nums, int N, int target, int* returnSize){
    int *arr = malloc(2*sizeof(int));
    *returnSize = 2;
    for(int i=0;i< N-1;i++){
        for(int j=i+1;j<N;j++){
            if((nums[i]+nums[j]==target))
            {
                arr[0]=i;arr[1]=j;
                return arr;
            }
        }
    }


    return arr;
  


}
QUESTION2
Roman to Integer
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
int DecimalNumericalPlace(char roman_np_solution)
{
    switch(roman_np_solution)
    {
        case 'M':
        return 1000;
        break;

        case 'D':
        return 500;
        break;

        case 'C':
        return 100;
        break;

        case 'L':
        return 50;
        break;

        case 'X':
        return 10;
        break;

        case 'V':
        return 5;
        break;

        case 'I':
        return 1;
        break;
        default :
        return -1;

    
    }

}



int romanToInt(char * s){
    int len=strlen(s);
    int sum=0;
    for(int i=0;s[i]!='\0';i++)
    {
        if(DecimalNumericalPlace(s[i])<DecimalNumericalPlace(s[i+1])){
        sum=sum-DecimalNumericalPlace(s[i]);
        

    }
    else{
        sum+=DecimalNumericalPlace(s[i]);
    }
    }
    return sum;













}

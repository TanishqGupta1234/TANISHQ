#task2
Jewels and Stones
You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
int numJewelsInStones(char * jewels, char * stones){
    int count=0;
    for(int i=0;i<strlen(jewels);i++){
        for(int j=0;j<strlen(stones);j++) {
            if(jewels[i]==stones[j]){
                count++;

            }
        }
